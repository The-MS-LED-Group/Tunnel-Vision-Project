# Tunnel Vision Client Statemtent

We need a custom solution to solve the off task tendancies that plague most people. We would like the solution to achieve the following:
 - Enhance focus by locking the user into the software.
    - Limit user search capabilities to tags or topics the user is currently working on or relavent to previous sessions/topics/
 - Create a *cozy* environment for the user.
    - Allow the user to select from preset color palettes or make their own.
    - Allow font changing
 - Have an internal Note-Taking system to avoid switching programs
    - Allow written notes with stylus and touch screen enabled devices
 - Have general planner capabilities; Calendar, to-do list, reminders etc.
 - Be able to load documents such as syllabus, textbook, homework handouts into the software and display them with snip/crop capabilities.
 - Make being off task as annoying and difficult as possible
     - Ask questions or solve simple puzzles when trying to click off or search something not related to the task at hand.
     - Have adjustable difficulty levels and a lockdown/cram mode with only one option to exit
- Gamify studying with Leaderboards, Achievements, experience points and level progression.
    - Create a weekly/monthly/yearly analysis document or "User Stats" with visual representations of search history topics, time spent searching, how relevant the searches were to each other, and aid the user in finding their "lacking stats" so that they can focus on what they don't understand.
