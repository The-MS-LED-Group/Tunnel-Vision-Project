# Tunnel Vision


#### Why Do We Need Tunnel Vision:
Current issues are a lack of focus when it comes to tasks that need to get done. For example, I have homework in classes that are perfectly spaced out, one homework due mondays, two due friday, one due every other friday; yet, when I sit down to attempt to make progress, I will end up becoming hyperfocused on something unrelated. Like searching for a new monitor or keyboard or browsing the *nice to haves, but in time* kind of items. My goal of Tunnel Vision is to create more friction points or *steps, clicks, actions* to begin going off task; while also minimizing the friction points towards progress in studies or homework.

#### What tools have you used in the past?
My current process involves having more willpower to tell myself I need to work instead of being off task. I have tried having a metronome or brown noise playing while working to have a sound or activity remove my hearing from becoming a source of distraction. I have found that when my motivation to work drops, if I manage to stay off my phone or find my way to something entertaining like a youtube video, tv show, or social media, I am more likely to return to my work in a reasonable amount of time. With the latter being hours of time wasted on youtube, netflix or the like. 

#### What would you like to see in **_YOUR_** idea of Tunnel Vision?
The largest requirements would be aiding those who are easily distracted get their work done. I could see this solution being a type of browser, browser extension, an app, or even a barebones operating system similar to Chrome OS or Windows Education edition. I would like to see:
- Timer function with the option to have a soft alarm or a hard alarm
   Soft alarm being a timer which does not tell you, your timer has ended.  
   Hard alarm being a timer with an indication that your timer has ended. Such as a Popup or audio indicator.
- Note taking capabilities
   It would be nice to be able to have a screenshot or snip capability. In order to have the system be all in one, if the files associated with the software are not plain text would be nice. 
- search restriction
   Having a search field that checks metadata for topics to ensure it has something to do with what the user is currently working on.
- User set primary tabs/Windows
   I see this being the tab/Window that has an assignment or required reading. Generally the current task for the user. This would be what additional tabs use as reference to ensure it has something to do with the task at hand.
