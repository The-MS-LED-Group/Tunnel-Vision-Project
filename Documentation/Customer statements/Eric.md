- Unless it is a call or possibly something that the user can mark as "important", do not interrupt my studying
- if watching videos, for example, only recommened the next video or super related video
- Give me study timers for healthy and productive studying (pomodoro, custom) (brain turns off after 3 hours straight so maybe a warning?)
- reminder to study, or take a break
- Give me motivation, maybe rewards or medals like duolingo
