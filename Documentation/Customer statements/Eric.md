# Customer Statement

#### Basic

- I want to be able to focus only on what I am doing for the day (reading, hw, etc.)
- Lock me out of everthing that is not what I am supposed to be focused on
- Unless it is a call or possibly something that the user can mark as "important", do not interrupt my studying
- if watching videos, for example, only recommened the next video or super related video
- Give me study timers for healthy and productive studying (pomodoro, custom) (brain turns off after 3 hours straight so maybe a warning?)
- reminder to study, or take a break
- Give me motivation, maybe rewards or medals like duolingo

#### Visual

- have warm, or cool colors for comfort and a "safe" feel
- fun little sounds and just general visually pleasing look
- Have a cool logo or little character

#### Other

- sync between desktop and mobile

#### Conclusion

- In general I want an application that not only helps me study but maybe even gives me motivation and makes learning "fun". Personally I have had a hard time having motivation to learn/study and have seen school as just something to get through rather than a learning experience. Basically, hopefully this app will raise grades and raise an interest in studying, or at the very least not make school so painful.
